# Extend the blog

Our blog turn out very successful. Now is the time to extend its functionality.

We would like you to add functionality for posting photos too. The way Tumblr does.

We would like to be able to post a photo by going to '/photos/new' where we would enter the URL of the photo in a text box.

We would like to be able to:
* list all photos by going to '/photos'
* view a specific photo by visiting '/photos/:id'

We would also like to be able to view both photos and posts when we go to our index page('/').
